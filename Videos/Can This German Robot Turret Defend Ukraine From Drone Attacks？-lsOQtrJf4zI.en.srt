1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,720
The German Skynext robot Gatling gun is

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,960
swatting Shahids out of the sky in

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,960
Ukraine. Ukraine's air force just

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,000
dropped fresh footage. That's equal

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,280
parts Top Gun and Duck Hunt. It features

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,280
something the Russian Ministry of

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,840
Defense probably hates more than a rainy

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,359
Victory Day parade. The Germanmade

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,320
Skynet system absolutely vaporizing Shy

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,880
drones over Ukraine. If you like seeing

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,880
high-tech gatling guns turn $50,000

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,599
kamicazi drones into overpriced

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,760
fireworks, stick around. Hey, it's Wes

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,840
here, former military guy, law school

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
grad, and professional seeker of things

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,200
that go boom. Now, I've covered the

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,920
German Skynext before, but this is not

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,600
your rerun. Ukraine's new video is the

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,000
first time we're seeing these systems

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,840
used in anger, and boy are they

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
delivering. Let's break down what just

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,320
happened. On July 12th, Ukraine's air

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
force released video showing their

24
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,800
German-made Skynext air defense system

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,199
at work. In a location the military

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,520
isn't revealing at a time they're not

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,760
going to tell us about. Ukrainian crews

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,159
lined up Russian Shyhei drones and

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,560
started racking up kills like it was ski

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,080
season. You can hear the Skynex's

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,799
operator. Target hit, target destroyed.

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,960
Repeat that at least seven times and you

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,439
get the vibe. Ukraine has received two

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,600
of these systems so far from Germany,

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,680
and based on this footage, they're

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,360
earning their keep. The Air Force called

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,200
the Skynext's results inspiring. And I'd

38
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,759
say that's an understatement. Unless

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,079
your job is flying drones for Russia.

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
Now, why does this matter so much? Well,

41
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,920
because Russia isn't letting up. We're

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,880
talking about mass drone and missile

43
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,759
barges night after night targeting not

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,320
just front lines but Kev, Lviv, and

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,280
cities deep in the Ukrainian rear. The

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,920
Russians keep thinking quantity will be

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,079
quality. Just lob enough Shahids at

48
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,719
Ukraine and something will get through.

49
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,439
That's where Skynext changes the math.

50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,439
Each Shahed cost about 50 grand and

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,280
Ukraine can't afford to intercept every

52
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,160
single one with a million dollar

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,239
missile. The Skynex is Germany's answer

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,560
to what if we just shot down these

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,959
things with a robot gatling gun instead.

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,840
So what makes the Skynex so effective?

57
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,840
Well, manufactured by Ryan Mal. Yep. The

58
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,720
same company that makes tank guns for

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,080
the Abrams and the Leopard. Skynex is a

60
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,560
mobile modular anti-aircraft artillery

61
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
system with all components being

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,840
containerized for easy transport. The

63
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
system uses the Orlicon XAR 3D

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,040
situational awareness and detection

65
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,440
radar capable of scanning up to a 50 km

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,760
radius. It's controlled via the Orlicon

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,599
Skymaster system which manages up to

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,720
four 35mm Oricon Mark III revolver gun

69
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,560
air defense cannons simultaneously. In

70
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,120
the US military, we call this type of

71
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
system a shore ad for short-range air

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,959
defense. This is different though than

73
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,280
traditional anti-aircraft missile

74
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,000
batteries like the Patriot in that the

75
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,959
Skynex is a cannon that uses

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,360
programmable air bursting ammunition.

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,200
And while a gun can still take down

78
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,280
aircraft, this particular system is

79
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,200
being used in Ukraine to assist with

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,599
drone defense. That's not to say the

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,920
Skynext can't work together with other

82
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,080
air defense systems. In fact, this is

83
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,400
one of its biggest selling points. This

84
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,239
interoperability allows for seamless

85
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,480
integration into Ukraine's existing

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,480
defense infrastructure, enhancing

87
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,400
overall tactical effectiveness. The

88
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,159
systems guns are housed in remotely

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,200
controlled turrets equipped with

90
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,200
advanced fire control systems, enabling

91
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,360
automated target acquisition and

92
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,720
engagement. This is all done using

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,400
narrow AI at the system level. Skynext

94
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,120
is armed with a variety of ammunition

95
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,920
types also, including the innovative

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,040
advanced hit efficiency and destruction

97
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,439
or a head munition. This programmable

98
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,080
ammunition is designed to release a

99
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,560
cloud of sub projectiles at an optimum

100
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,720
range determined by an integrated laser

101
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
rangefinder, spraying a cloud of

102
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,120
tungsten projectiles like a claymore

103
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,760
mine in the air to effectively

104
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,400
neutralize both large drones and smaller

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,639
UAV swarms. The Orlicon revolver gun

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,239
Mark III spits out up to a thousand

107
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,560
rounds per minute with a range of 4 km.

108
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,800
Think of it as a shotgun blast that

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,600
covers a whole swarm of drones. The

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,000
Skynext's radar tracks the incoming UAV,

111
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,440
calculates the exact moment to detonate

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,759
the shell and poof, no more Shahid. The

113
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,560
footage Ukraine released shows exactly

114
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,160
that. Drones dropping one after another

115
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,160
like flies at a bug zapper convention.

116
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,520
But it's not just raw firepower. Skynext

117
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,600
isworked air defense. It can connect

118
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,759
with other sensors, radar, and fire

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,160
units. And it's designed to defeat

120
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,120
saturation attacks. Think dozens of

121
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,080
drones coming in at once. This is

122
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,479
layered, modular, and mobile. A system

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,639
built for the battlefield of 2025, not

124
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,639
the Gulf War. Perhaps the biggest

125
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,320
advantage of Skynext though compared to

126
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,320
something like the Patriot missile

127
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,800
battery is the speed with which the

128
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,360
system can be packed up and moved to a

129
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,440
new location. In theory, this should

130
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
allow Ukraine to experiment with

131
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,600
locations that need them the most. And

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,919
this portability also makes them harder

133
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,280
targets for Russian strikes. Not that

134
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,600
Russia would target them anyways, as

135
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,440
they seem happy to attack civilians over

136
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
military targets. Wait, why does the

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
Russian military keep hitting civilian

138
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,479
targets? Oh, because they're right. I

139
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,960
forgot.

140
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,120
High five. All right.

141
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,759
So, why does Berlin keep sending these

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,680
things to Ukraine? Because every Skynext

143
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,479
delivered is a direct answer to Russia's

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,720
new strategy. Overwhelm the defenders,

145
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,120
break their will, and knock out the

146
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,199
power grid by brute force. Kev's

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,759
response is to turn every Shahed raid

148
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,000
into an arms fair for Western systems.

149
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,039
And Skynext just became the poster child

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,639
for modern gun-based air defense. Plus,

151
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
every time Ukraine posts one of these

152
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,039
videos, it's a recruiting ad for Rhinel

153
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,360
and a warning to the Kremlin. This is

154
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,000
way more than helping Ukraine. It's beta

155
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,400
testing Germany's nextgen air defense in

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,960
the world's ugliest proving ground. Of

157
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,680
course, two Skynext systems don't turn

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Ukraine into an impenetrable fortress.

159
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,000
There are gaps, big ones. Ukraine needs

160
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,240
dozens, not pairs, if it wants to cover

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,400
all of its critical infrastructure. The

162
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,319
reality is that you need layered

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,639
defense. Patriots for ballistic

164
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,520
missiles, Iris T and NASAMS for cruise

165
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,160
missiles, and Skynex for drones and

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,840
mobile teams for mop-up duty. Right now,

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,319
Ukraine is fighting with the world's

168
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,639
most patchwork air defense. But this

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,280
patch just got a lot stronger. Here's

170
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,479
the bottom line. Skynex is a lot more

171
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,039
than just a fancy German toy. It's a

172
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:59,120
necessary, timely, and frankly

173
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,160
satisfying answer to Russia's cheap

174
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,520
drone blitzcream. Every Shahed shot down

175
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,639
is one less apartment block burning. One

176
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,479
more night, the lights stay on in Kev.

177
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,360
So, next time you see a video of a

178
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,240
Ukrainian operator calmly calling target

179
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,840
destroyed, remember that's the sound of

180
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,080
adaptation, innovation, and Germany and

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,800
Ukraine quietly sending Russia's drone

182
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,599
war back to the drawing board. That's it

183
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,319
for today. If you learned something new,

184
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,400
