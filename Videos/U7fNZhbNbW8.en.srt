00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
In a chilling display of modern warfare,

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,640
newly released footage Footage from

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,800
Ukrainian sources paints a vivid picture

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
of the relentless drone campaign being

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,120
waged against Russian troops on the

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,360
front lines. From precision strikes on

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,840
armored vehicles to brutal close-range

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,000
engagements, the videos provide a rare

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,719
and raw glimpse into how drones are

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,120
reshaping the battlefield.

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,920
In one of the most controversial clips,

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,320
an FPV Kamicaza 8 drone hovers just

14
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,280
inches from a motionless Russian soldier

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,079
for several ten seconds. The soldier,

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,320
visibly broken and unarmed, sits still

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,520
as the drone seemingly considers his

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,080
fate. Then, without warning, it slams

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,980
into his head. A moment that has ignited

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,600
debate over the ethics of such strikes.

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
In another encounter, two Russian

23
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
soldiers are seen fighting off a

24
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,240
kamicazi drone with their rifles,

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,720
narrowly avoiding friendly fire. When

26
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,799
they run out of ammunition, one soldier

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,360
throws his rifle at the drone,

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,040
triggering a blast at close range. It's

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,040
unclear if he survived the explosion.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,439
A dramatic combination of drone and

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,320
phone footage captures the moment a

32
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,320
grenade dropped by a Ukrainian drone

33
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,960
explodes near two Russian soldiers

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,119
riding a utility vehicle. Injured and

35
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,360
disoriented, they abandon their

36
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,360
transport and flee on foot in search of

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,360
help.

38
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,880

39
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,360
Ukrainian drone painted in national

40
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,759
colors striking the entrance of an

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,399
underground Russian position. Moments

42
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,640
later, dazed Russian troops emerge and

43
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,490

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,879

Russian soldier is caught on drone

camera hurling a brick at an incoming

49
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,000
drone. He misses. The drone detonates

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,319
with deadly precision.

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319

inside a destroyed shipping container

53
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,360
shows no resistance as a Ukrainian drone

54
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,640
sneaks in and explodes, suggesting

55
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,640
either confusion or surrender.

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,760
Ukrainian FPV drone operators have also

57
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,400
proven adept at targeting advanced

58
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,640
Russian hardware. Footage shows a T90

59
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,040
tank being picked apart with calculated

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,519
drone strikes. After disabling the

61
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,760
engine and optics, a final hit causes

62
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,840
the tank to burst into flames.

troops packed inside a barn just before

69
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
it's hit by an incendiary drone. The

70
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,040
resulting fireball collapses the

71
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,040
structure, likely causing numerous

72
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,159
casualties.

attempting to recover a tank stuck in

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,200
mud. The drone's explosion completely

78
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,720
obliterates the front half of the BTR,

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,180
scattering debris across the

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,280

In yet another incident, three Russian

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,560
soldiers retreat to a bunker inside the

84
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,799
ruins of a home. A Ukrainian drone

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,959
follows and detonates at the entrance,

86
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,439
collapsing the structure and burying the

87
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,439
soldiers alive.

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,239
target strategic assets. In one clip, a

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,640
Russian drone operator station is

91
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,159
struck, igniting stored fuel and

92
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,159
ammunition into a raging inferno.

Perhaps one of the most surreal moments

95
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,120
is when a Ukrainian FPV drone lands

96
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,000
quietly at the entrance of a Russian

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,080
drone base. A soldier steps out,

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,639
seemingly mistaking it for a friendly

99
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,080
unit. As he approaches, the drone

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,080
detonates in a powerful blast.

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,080
Even freshly upgraded Russian armor

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,639
isn't spared. AT72 tank, freshly painted

103
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,199
and retrofitted, is quickly immobilized

104
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,759
and destroyed by a combination of FPV

105
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,560

of the armed forces of Ukraine, the

113
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,720
Pakovsk front saw the most intense

114
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,199

115

In the Daetsk region, Ukrainian FPV

123
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,080
outskirts of Navakatsky where a group of

125
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,919
Russian assault troops had taken cover.

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,240
The precision strike collapsed the

the rubble, Ukrainian officials said.

129
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,680
Near the village of Ivanki, a Russian

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,520
BMP3 infantry fighting vehicle became

131
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,360
stuck in a trench while attempting to

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,400
deliver an assault group to the front

134
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,440
and were immediately struck by Ukrainian

135
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
drone munitions and artillery fire,

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,280
